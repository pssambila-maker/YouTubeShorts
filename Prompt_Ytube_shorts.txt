You are an expert full‑stack engineer and architect. Your job is to design a complete, simple plan for an offline/local MVP app similar to Nexusclips, but running on my own computer.
New scope and constraints:
* I already have long‑form video files stored locally on my computer.
* I do NOT need Firebase, user auth, or hosting.
* I want a simple app ( minimal GUI) that:
   1. Lets me choose a local video file.
   2. Analyzes it (using transcription + an AI model) to find the best highlight moments.
   3. Outputs a list of suggested clips with start/end timestamps, titles, and caption text that I can later upload to YouTube as Shorts.
* Optional “nice to have”: use FFmpeg or similar to actually cut the video into separate clip files on disk.
* I will use Visual Studio / VS Code as my IDE.
* I will use Claude Code to generate and edit all code.
* I am OK with a Node.js or Python implementation; pick one and stick with it.
Please produce a clear, 8th‑grade‑friendly implementation plan that I can hand directly to Claude Code.
1. Define the MVP scope: exactly what this local app WILL do and what it will NOT do in version 1.
2. Propose the tech stack and folder structure for a small project that lives on my machine (no cloud backend).
3. Explain how the app should work end‑to‑end for a single video file:
   * how the user selects or specifies the video path
   * how the audio is extracted (e.g., with FFmpeg)
   * how transcription is done (e.g., Whisper or another local/hosted ASR)
   * how an AI model (like Claude) scores and selects highlight segments
   * how suggested clips (timestamps + titles + captions) are saved (e.g., JSON file, CSV, or text report).
4. Describe how to optionally integrate FFmpeg so the app can actually cut the suggested clips into short MP4 files in an `output_clips/` folder.
5. Specify a simple user interface:
   * Either a command‑line interface (CLI) where I run `node index.js path/to/video.mp4` or `python main.py ...`,
   * OR a very simple local GUI (you choose which is easier for an MVP).
6. Define the main modules / files and what each one does (for example: `transcribeVideo`, `findHighlights`, `exportClipsReport`, `cutClipsWithFfmpeg`).
7. Write a “task list for Claude Code” that I can paste into Claude Code as instructions. The tasks should be ordered and small, for example:
   * Initialize the project with a basic `package.json` (or `requirements.txt`) and install dependencies.
   * Add a CLI entry file that accepts a video path argument.
   * Implement a helper to call FFmpeg to extract audio.
   * Implement a transcription function (you can mock the ASR in v1 if needed).
   * Implement a highlight‑selection function that takes transcript text and returns clip suggestions.
   * Implement saving a `clips_report.json` and `clips_report.txt` to disk.
   * (Optional) Implement actual video cutting with FFmpeg into `./output_clips`.
8. For each task, include:
   * which files Claude Code should create or edit
   * what functions it should implement and what inputs/outputs they have
   * any assumptions, TODOs, or placeholders (for example, “later replace this mock transcript with a real ASR call”).
Use clear headings and bullet points. Assume I know basic JavaScript/Python but want instructions simple enough that an 8th‑grade student could follow them step by step.
